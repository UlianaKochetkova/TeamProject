Hi, this is a channel for operational information for the 2nd course of the FCN PI. \pPo, you can get into the general chat using the discuss button.\pI in the channel and in the chat there will be employees of the Training Office, take this into account\n\Pet channel and chat will allow you to be in touch quickly, especially on the eve of the protection of the Kyrgyz Republic and other things.\Add your classmates \nP. S. And add yourself to the chat using the Discussion button. This is also important
Yes, I made a typo. Thank you for noticing. Today is also the deadline for those who defend themselves on April 19
And why does someone have a deadline of 1 and someone has 3 days. \Did I not understand something?\n\Pet is a concession to students who do not have time for anything?
And when is the deadline for those who defend themselves 24?
Most likely due to the fact that the weekend is not working
The deadline for documents depends on the date of protection. You must download all the documentation 3 days before the protection. You must upload the repo and the presentation a day before the protection.
Thanks
Guys who went through the process of signing a contract with the company for practice (for work): what is the procedure for doing this? First, sign a contract with the CPPR, and then prepare all the documents (schedule, task, review) and send an application or in another way?
I got lost in the instructions in the LMS
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Jb3D2blLe-_NujwOCNTCN0N4_LY2C0i9Y8s_bh4Vkbc/edit
Please tell me. It is written that additional disciplines can be included in the limit of 60 credits. Does this mean that I can replace a course from the elective disciplines with some additional discipline?
When choosing a faculty \For your campus\ - means only for students. who are participating in the faculty where this subject is taught? Does
anyone know what it means when you click in the lms on a task for prkatika and this happens
and where to load the schedule and that's all?
Load everything into the project in the LMS, in the discipline. If the application for practice does not want to be in a good way, we always have an answer - to the project in the discipline
I understand, thank you very much!
guys, who else does Gromov have in practice? write to the bos plz
And how to pass the sop?
I answered everything, wrote the text, and here it is
I tried again, it doesn't work
And now?
I tried it via edge
It worked
Maybe my browser is blunted
No, there is some kind of authorization problem there, as far as I know
In practice: is it possible to sign and upload a PDF?
yes, you can
Thank you
, is it enough to send a scan to the cppr, or do you need to come in person?
and what kind of document are we talking about here?
Task
a scan of what?
Agreements
We need a paper version of the contract, 2 copies.
and the task and the schedule should be shipped only to the LMS? don't you need to bring it?
Are you talking about the contract?
you do not need to bring the task and the schedule, you need to upload it to the project in the LMS discipline

Rimma Zakievna, the current design of the practice is a real madness
I would not want future generations to face something like this
+
This is the first time you have encountered just. Federal requirements, see laws and orders.\What exactly is difficult?
it is necessary to go to the ministry or to the Duma, pass laws, issue orders )) it
is difficult to formalize all this, fill it out, sign it from someone, and this is all get
used to, this is adult life.
(
And what to do if the CPPR does not have time to review the contract before the deadline? I gave the contract with the seals 3 days ago, there are no changes in the table
Fill out an application for practice to get into the order. \pSeyshe contracts are signed by the dean, we will issue them in a week. Let's hurry up
Yulia Getun said that you can skip the contract number if they don't have time to register
,
and if you sign up for an extra course, you can then unsubscribe?
question to the training office
Dear students!\Do not forget - Head of the production practice from the HSE Faculty of Economics - R. Z. Akhmetsafina, Associate Professor of the Department of PI.\If you specified Avdoshin S. M. or Lebedev S. A., correct it
If you have not yet chosen a place of practice, pay attention to Empathy (see the CPPR website)
And what should I do if the manager does not sign the individual task and schedule, because he says that I am not in practice, but on an internship? :)
We need to persuade him. Tell me that this is the right combination of useful and useful
what a bureaucrat!
He just says that this is a different contract, so he will not be the head, but I will be practicing in another place (this is Sberbank)
Usually practice and internship are combined. For the first time I hear that the manager is against
Dear students! \n Tell me, please, are there any scala fans ? I wanted to get a little advice and an expert opinion.. Please respond in L. S. üôè
Is it possible not to attach a copy of the contract in the application for practice yet? I'm a smart girl and I didn't do a scan before taking it to the CPPR...
You can not attach it )
In the examples for the task and the schedule, Avdoshin SM is still standing, is this how it should be ?
What should I do if the signatures and seals have already been put, and Lebedev is listed as the head of the practice?
TO FROM? It's not so scary, fix it in the application to the LMS
No, I'm on all the documents , including the contract
Where in the contract is there a place for the head of the FCN?
Oh, yes, I'm sorry, everything is OK there
If I moved the practice a week ahead, is it possible to fill out the schedule and schedule directly when I start the practice? It is difficult to say what the schedule will be at the moment( You
can
Are there any examples of TK for practice?
At what point should I sound the alarm if my contract has not yet appeared in the register of contracts, but I took the contract to the CPPR a week ago?
The contract is signed, it remains to get a number. We will inform everyone
Good afternoon, this applies only to those whose deadlines have been postponed or can everyone be shipped FROM and schedule after 23?
It is possible for everyone
OK, thank you
What is the reason for this error? All fields are filled in.
Hello, do I understand correctly that we are filling out an item with production practice in the LMS ? It's just that there is still a pre-diploma and it's a little confusing.
Yes
There is also a question about the details of the contract in the item \ Employee of the organization coordinating the internship\. I understand correctly that if you are doing an internship at the FCN, you do not need to fill in this item?
Thank you )
In this field, you need to select from the drop-down list, and not write the
guys who will be practicing in a third-party company, write pliz to the bos, there are a couple of questions
Here you need to write, or rather choose, the person with the FKN, with whom you are undergoing an internship
I understand thank you )
Did you manage to get around it?
You need to select a manager from the drop-down list
And who is there to choose at all?
ARZ
a, Thank you
Do you have this form being sent now? I filled in all the fields, click Confirm and nothing happens for some reason
I just sent
It just happened
The contract number should be here? I will
post it a little later
Can I send you all the documents by email, except for the report? It's just that until July 26, it seems like we need to solve the issue with the transfer
With a statement about the transfer to the name of Shilov, of course
Or is it not needed?
Not obligatory
Hello! Tell me, do you need to fill in an individual task and a schedule with signatures today?
You can do it later, the main thing is an application for practice
It is better not to delay the application for the practice. Ask a question to the training office of Pak and Karpova on deadlines for applications.\ They will issue orders on practices by name
And what is written in the lms \If it is not known where you will undergo an internship (the company has not yet announced whether it accepts you), the training office will wait until June 26, 2021.\ - is it relevant?
Do we need seals somewhere, or are only the signatures of the head enough?
Yesterday, the office called this date
Sorry if you've already asked. \n\If I miss all the deadlines, will it be possible to close it with a certificate of illness so that there is no non-payment?
Seals are needed on the contract and in the appendices of the calendar plan, signatures of the head of the practice are enough
You can, like, write a statement about transferring the practice to other dates
It's still for the summer. And there is also an option with winter, and according to the certificate it is there
Good afternoon!\n\n I can go to an internship with a teacher of the FKN, but if his topic is not in the list of tasks for practice?\n\If yes, how do I do it? Does the teacher need to send the practice to the general task list?
Yes, you must send a completed contract without signatures and seals
If you took it to the cppr
And what kind of contract is this anyway?
HSE with the company or the Company with me?
I don't know about the second one at all
I didn't include\n\n in the sense that I had to do something about the contract at all, if the company was originally in the registry?
And if the practice is based on the means of an offer letter and an acceptance letter, then you need to respond to this letter somehow?
You do not need to add a topic to the general table. Fill out the application, the task and the calendar plan
Right. Does not apply
HSE with the company
No need
No need to react
Good afternoon! My supervisor is temporarily not in the Russian Federation and at best will sign all the documents sometime next week \pmnot it better to write an application for the transfer of practice, or is a small delay in downloading the signed documents not critical?
A small delay is not critical
Thanks!
I know a few things, in general, all signatures should be attached to the report, because that's when the assessment will be made. But to understand the situation, it is better, of course, in advance
Bondarev Andrey Olegovich\pEvdokimov Maxim Artemovich\pConnova Margarita Dmitrievna\pKrasnov Alexander Andreevich\pTibilov Taimuraz Valerievich\Psharipov Ainur Aivarovich\n
And as a head from the FKN, he should be indicated as a research associate, not a guest teacher
And what if, when trying to indicate a supervisor as a researcher, the lms diligently tries to change him to a visiting teacher? If I write a comment to the application , will it be counted?)\nProsto, for some reason, my supervisor is only in the database as a teacher
So, he is no longer a researcher. Then from FKN write me
Maxim Evdokimov and Andrey Bondarev corrected
Alexander Krasnov corrected
Konnova Margarita remained
she seems to have corrected it too
Well
Hello. If the dates are incorrectly specified for the practice, do you need to re-upload the documents in the lms project?
the main thing is to correct the application for practice, it is better to re-upload the documents too
Dear students!\n\n All corrections made by you are taken into account. The corrected rows / cells are colored green.\The values that are not corrected are colored yellow.I also ask you to pay attention to the comments in the cells - it says what you need to fix in the applications (I made corrections in the table, but the same values remained in the applications in the LMS).\pNado do all this as quickly as possible.\PSO notify me about the results necessarily.\pr. Z. Akhmetsafina, 01.07.2021
You should have 3 weeks of practice
I remember what they said about the specific number of days during which I should undergo an internship. I specified the required amount in the schedule
Does it say somewhere what to do if I missed everything and I get an academic debt?
So you don't get it, you're on the certificate
If you need to specify specifically for the order, for example, from 1 to 21, then ok\n in general, I would like to hear confirmation
Well, it turns out that this is a retake on the certificate. And in what form is it?
You don't get it. It is necessary to make an application for the postponement of the practice, send it to Shilov for signature.\n Fill out an application for practice.\Agreement or letters\Assignment and calendar plan
Thanks!
I wrote in the ad how to count dates, look at it.

Dear students! Professor Vadim Valerievich Podbelsky died. He was at the origins of Software Engineering at the HSE. RIP
Bright memory to him...\n\pa what happened? How did this happen, why?
In a communal apartment
Can I pick up the offer today?
It's Sunday today. Weekend
And can you put them in a separate cabinet (as it was with the contracts) so that you can pick them up during non-working hours?
They may get lost. By agreement
What time can I come to pick it up today?
up to 18 hours
channel,
chat,
Andrey, not a new center, but they landed us in the CPPR))
I know. But it seemed to me that then it would be less clear. And the word direction (as it was in the letters) sounds too much like something educational. Although it would be possible to write a new direction of the work of the CPPR
I don't like the word direction either. Students will also look for a new center on the FKN)), if you do not explain that this is a CPPR. Probably, I will have to add another P to the abbreviation ))
Yes, I did not think that someone could look for it on the HSE website. Changed to \the direction of the work of the cppr\ but the change is displayed only in the main channel

Is it possible to sign scans of documents if the head is in another city?

(if the deadline is July 1-21)
No, in October, well, not?
In September.

well, you can in different, I do well in pdf, so I wrote it like this ))\ pA the mouse does not work at all...
Hello, I wrote to cppr. cs on Friday, there is still no answer, can you answer, please?
And until what date do you need to bring a letter of acceptance in paper form to the cppr?
Until September. Upload the scan to the LMS now. The original can be sent by mail

Who should I send an application to change the course project for the 3rd year? The supervisor agreed on everything and signed it
On the trail. this week, a form will appear for changing the topic and / or the head of the course project. We will inform you.\nappearance - in the name of the academy. the head, prof. DPI V, V. Shilova
From September 1, only students who are not included in the "risk zone"will be able to attend classes. The mask mode is maintained in all buildings of the Tower.

Will it be possible to visit all couples remotely in our country?
+
And, by the way, can a person who has a criterion, on the contrary, visit online?
+ \ pochen is a good and important question
You can at least not upload the status confirmation to the ELK, 4 picture
It is better to download, everyone checks it, there may be trouble
Uh,
I think there are unlikely to be problems with this, especially if it is organized online for the unvaccinated
It's just that we need to include both people who live abroad and those who work 40 hours. It is quite easy to visit even all couples and at the same time have time to work, but the time on the road to the university can simply deprive people of such an opportunity. Of course, from a formal point of view, this is not important, but from a human point of view, of course, otherwise
(before covid, people somehow lived)
Yes, I understand, but it's about the fact that now it will not be possible to rebuild dramatically
Including skipping couples for the sake of work
Well, by the way, there were a lot of people who had this
And here there is an opportunity not to miss, but to watch online
with covid, it became much easier to do this

Good evening, I have such a question.On August 13, Sobyanin canceled the decree on mandatory vaccination of 60% of employees and permanent PCR tests.\n\n Did this somehow affect the tower? Will unvaccinated couples be allowed to visit?
Not yet
In general, 1) We are not employees, 2) We do not obey Sobyanin (as well as the Ministry of Education and Science, by the way)
Very, very, very sorry,

Wheeeeee!
Do I understand correctly that full-time classes have no alternative?
> no more than 50 people will be able to stay in one classroom, at least a quarter of the classes will be organized in a synchronous remote format.
Cool!
Everything returns to the 4 module format. That is, we can at least have a full distance
*I'm waiting and I believe in it*

It is unlikely to be for the 4th year, I was told from the UO that I should come :(
You meant \it is unlikely to be for the 1st course\?) Why should
we be full-time?
Not for our, well, I could not come, someone can work from home and study ...

Who can tell you where to find an example of a practice report?
See the approximate content of the report, you have it in the task
Good afternoon! Actually, I wanted to go online. The audience was booked just in case.
and what is more convenient for you?
Online that
's great. Today, however, we were informed that everyone goes to classes offline. But there are a lot of online classes in the schedule
(many have everything, to be precise) a
lot (everything)

Ideally, everything should be online, because many people are already working)
I agree

you be from home or in the classroom?
when and how, but more often not from the audience
Just if from the audience, I would be happy to come to you ... Eh...
if you knew how much I missed full-time classes... Even taking into account the fact that I'm working now...

1) you can re-send\n2) it is better to sign
Thank you, Nikolai! 4 course, yes,
rename another IMPORTANT thing, pliz
I can
At the moment, the practice page is not clickable, where to fill the docks? (
Isn't it in the 3rd course?
oh) thank you)
Good evening! I found out that in my report, the assessment from the head of the company is in the column for the assessment from the FCN. It will no longer be possible to get a new signature of the manager. If there will be noticeable traces of correction, is this a big problem?
Vasily, don't fix it, we'll figure it out. Nothing wrong
Rimma Zakievna, what should I do if I just found out that I made a mistake with the head in the order for practice? (he indicated the director of the organization to whose name the offer letter was sent, and not the direct manager)
It is unlikely that something can be corrected in the order now. \ppprobuy to sign the review and report from the director of the organization.\ n You can provide a review and a report with two signatures - the real head of the practice and the director
We were not given such information
That is, it is necessary to find and attach an NDA agreement?
I will look at the report, write comments.
what kind of assurance about the circumstances do
you not need, Yandex has a contract
Why not? The contract is not necessary, but it was necessary
Exactly, it is in the annex to the contract
Okay
What should I do if I gave an acceptance and an assurance about the circumstances to the cppr, and did not make a scan? Can I not download it?
So it was necessary to have it even before the start of practice, now why again?
It didn't work out before the start)
Well, you passed
Well, yes, but there are projects for downloading in the lms
So these are the old ones, they are just all up to today
So you don't need to download them?
If you have given applications to the CPPR, write about it in notepad and upload this file to the project so that we know.\ pCPPR makes scans of all documents for registration in the document management system, we will find the scans at home
Everything is already closed there, nothing can be sent
Today we will open until Friday

And who can I turn to if couples crossed paths on Tuesday in the specialization of industrial software engineering? Natalia Devisheva does not answer
She answered me, said that the overlap will be eliminated by next week
And they will return the first pair?

No, this is not about sociology

They said about sociology the problem is being solved

Last year I saw information that it is possible to issue an electronic version of the certificate for the military enlistment office (although it appeared after I went to the second department and spent an hour in line). \n\psey now I can't find anywhere, this opportunity is no longer there, or will it appear again later?
This question is sent to the training office. As far as I know, the curator of the 4th course is Yulia Oris. Consider yourself lucky.
I finally got through to the number of the second department, and they told me \the number you dialed is not serviced\ and reset it)))\n\pTak that apparently I will go to them today, since I need to take a student, and he needs to get help\n\If someone has more questions, so that I ask them there-write
Well, gentlemen, I went to the second department.\n\nThe phone is really theirs, and local employees really answer it like that, several more people there said that they were answered the same way.\n\n At the same time, only one of the two employees who are engaged in these certificates there works-why didn't they tell me\n\nNo and that's not all!The head of the second department, whose mail is indicated in the contacts , is dismissed, and in addition to receiving a certificate, it must also be signed somewhere on the Cover\n\pA in addition, the schedule indicated on their website and in all other places - also invalid\n\pNu and yes, if someone suddenly doubted - there is a stable +- 30 people in total sitting in the queue at the entrance and on the floor where the certificate is issued.\n\n At the same time, today we collect studaks, they will be given back again at the end of September, and the certificate to the military enlistment office should be taken to October 1, but to get a certificate for all data, a studak is needed (but someone says that you can just use your passport)\n\It is impossible to confuse the information whether it is possible without a student, since the only two existing contacts of the second department do not work, and you need to sit for two hours to learn something live
Yulia Oris, by the way, replied to me that the training office has no other information
Please tell me where you can contact with this information except for the red button, and then you don't want to join the army this year)))
I am also very interested in the question of what prevents me from making inquiries online as well as in the UO, given that no special information is needed for this, and the second department is one for all (!) buildings and all (!) courses, despite the fact that the registration of this certificate for first-timers takes 15 minutes, and for the next courses +-2, and the queue for all is one\nNo this is already, as I understand it, utopia
